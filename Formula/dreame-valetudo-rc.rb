# Homebrew formula for the PRERELEASE (release-candidate) channel of the personal tap.
#
# This is a SEPARATE formula from the stable `dreame-valetudo`. Between stable releases `brew install
# sisyphusmd/tap/dreame-valetudo-rc` tracks the newest `-rc.N`; when a stable ships, update-tap.sh
# re-points this formula at that stable tarball (fall-through), so the rc channel keeps resolving
# after the now-superseded rc releases are pruned. It exists so a release candidate can be validated
# on hardware through the same Homebrew path real users take, without pointing the stable formula at
# a candidate build.
# Same source-venv install as the stable formula (see dreame-valetudo.rb for the design notes).
# The prerelease workflow fills in url/sha per rc.
#
# Install:  brew install sisyphusmd/tap/dreame-valetudo-rc

      This is a RELEASE CANDIDATE of dreame-valetudo, for hardware validation. For the stable
      release use `dreame-valetudo` instead. It roots robot vacuums — read the risks first:
        #{homepage}

      Just run `dreame-valetudo` (no arguments). On the first run it builds sunxi-fel from source
      (needs a compiler + network, one time) and fetches the pinned Valetudo binary. It talks to
      the robot over the robot's own Wi-Fi AP, not your LAN.

      Your workspace lives under ~/dreame-valetudo/ (work/ + backups/). After upgrading, the first
      run migrates it automatically, or run `dreame-valetudo migrate`. Uninstalling never touches
      it: your factory backups under ~/dreame-valetudo/backups/ survive.
