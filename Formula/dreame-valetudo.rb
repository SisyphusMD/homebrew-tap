# Homebrew formula for a personal tap (SisyphusMD/homebrew-tap).
#
# A source install of the Python package into an isolated virtualenv on the user's machine — so
# there is NO Apple notarization requirement (that applies only to the separate signed .pkg). It is
# arch-agnostic: the package is pure Python, and the libusb fastboot client runs via `uv` on every
# OS/arch, so a single `brew install` covers macOS (Apple Silicon or Intel) AND Linux (amd64/arm64).
# Self-contained from the user's side: Homebrew provides python@3.14 + the venv; no user-managed
# Python. (The .pkg/.deb ship a PyInstaller-frozen bundle instead, for machines without uv.)
# The release workflow fills in url/sha per version.
#
# Install:  brew install sisyphusmd/tap/dreame-valetudo

      dreame-valetudo roots robot vacuums. Read the risks first:
        #{homepage}

      Just run `dreame-valetudo` (no arguments). On the first run it builds sunxi-fel from source
      (needs a compiler + network, one time) and fetches the pinned Valetudo binary. It talks to
      the robot over the robot's own Wi-Fi AP, not your LAN.

    if OS.linux?
      s += <<~EOS

        Linux USB access (so you don't need sudo): install the bundled udev rule once:
          sudo install -m0644 #{pkgshare}/99-dreame-valetudo.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
          sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
